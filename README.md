# Toy Story - Depth of Field Simulation

## Intent
- Creating a scene using WebGL
- Simulating Depth of Field effect on the custom scene
- Using shaders to create the DoF effect

## Depth of Field
Depth of Field is the effect in which objects within some range of distances of a scene appear in focus. The objects nearer and farther than this range will appear out of focus.
A lens usually let the light pass through a film or the retina: when the light converges to a single point in the film, the lightâ€™s source will appear in focus. Everything else will be projected to an area called **Circle of Confusion**.
This area defines what part of the object will appear in focus or not.
The figure below shows how a lens captures an object and creates a Circle of Confusion; it also shows the parameters involved.

## The Project
The project has been implemented in WebGL: particularlly, the scene has been created by using [three.js](https://threejs.org). Three.js is a cross-browser Open Source Javascript library that uses WebGL to create and display animated 3D computer graphics scene. It simplifies the creation of complex 3D scenes (which could be difficult using only Javascript).
Three.js creates a scene adding objects defined by a geometry (which corresponds to a vertex shader) and a material (which corresponds to a fragment shader).
It also provides method to implement user controls, post-processing effects, etc..
The Depth of Field effect has been implemented by a fragment shader.

### Pipeline
#### Initialize the Scene
- Camera
- Controls (Pointer Lock Controls, provided by three.js)
#### Load the objects on the Scene

- Light and Chandelier
- Room
- Dices
- Ball
- Bed
- Woody
- Buzz Lightyear
#### Collision Detection
To detect room walls and bed, so that the user can't pass through them
#### Application of Depth of Field Effect
#### Audio Files & GUI
- 'Hai un amico in me' - Riccardo Cocciante, from Toy Story Soundtrack
- GUI that let the user change *Aperture* and *Plane in Focus*

## How Depth of Field is Implemented?
- **Step 1.** Implement a routine that let apply external GLSL shaders to a three.js scene.
- **Step 2.** Implement the fragment shader that simulates the DoF effect.

### Step 1 - Rendering to Texture
To apply a fragment shader to a three.js scene, Render to Texture technique has been used. The scene has been processed separately from what the user truly see. Once this scene has been rendered, it is displayed in a texture consisting of a fixed plane (rendered too). Thus, the user can see the Toy Story scene with Depth of Field applied, on this plane.

### Step 2 - Depth of Field Shader
To simulate the Depth of Field, it is only necessary to change the value of color's pixels. The vertex shader does not have to do anything:
```html
  <script type="x-shader/x-vertex" id="DOFVertexShader">
     varying vec2 vUv;
     void main(){
         vUv = uv;
         gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4( position, 1.0 );
     }
</script>
```
